## 4. Get Shipment by ID

Replace `{shipment_id}` with the actual shipment ID from the create response:

```bash
curl -X GET "$BASE_URL/shipments/{shipment_id}"
```

### Example with Real ID

curl -X GET "$BASE_URL/shipments/distance-duration?pickupAddress=Mumbai%2C%20Maharashtra%2C%20India&dropAddress=Delhi%2C%20India"
```

### URL Encoded Version

```bash
curl -X GET "$BASE_URL/shipments/distance-duration" \
  -G \
  -d "pickupAddress=Mumbai, Maharashtra, India" \
  -d "dropAddress=Delhi, India"
```

## Advanced Examples

### Batch Cost Calculations

Create a script to calculate costs for multiple routes:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Array of routes
routes=(
  '{"pickup": "Mumbai", "drop": "Delhi", "vehicle": "truck", "weight": 5000}'
  '{"pickup": "Bangalore", "drop": "Chennai", "vehicle": "mini_truck", "weight": 2000}'
  '{"pickup": "Pune", "drop": "Hyderabad", "vehicle": "tempo", "weight": 3000}'
)

for route in "${routes[@]}"; do
  pickup=$(echo $route | jq -r '.pickup')
  drop=$(echo $route | jq -r '.drop')
  vehicle=$(echo $route | jq -r '.vehicle')
  weight=$(echo $route | jq -r '.weight')

  echo "Calculating cost for $pickup to $drop..."

  curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/shipments/calculate-cost" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{
      \"pickupAddress\": \"$pickup, India\",
      \"dropAddress\": \"$drop, India\",
      \"vehicleType\": \"$vehicle\",
      \"weight\": $weight
    }" | jq '.data.totalCost'

  echo "---"
done
```

### Error Handling Examples

### Invalid Vehicle Type

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/shipments/calculate-cost" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "pickupAddress": "Mumbai, India",
    "dropAddress": "Delhi, India",
    "vehicleType": "invalid_vehicle",
    "weight": 5000
  }'
```

### Missing Required Fields

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/shipments/calculate-cost" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "pickupAddress": "Mumbai, India",
    "weight": 5000
  }'
```

### Invalid Weight

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/shipments/calculate-cost" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "pickupAddress": "Mumbai, India",
    "dropAddress": "Delhi, India",
    "vehicleType": "truck",
    "weight": -1000
  }'
```

echo -e "\n6. Testing distance calculation..."
curl -s -X GET "$BASE_URL/shipments/distance-duration?pickupAddress=Mumbai&dropAddress=Delhi" | jq '.'

# Test 7: Delete shipment
echo -e "\n7. Testing delete shipment..."
curl -s -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/shipments/$SHIPMENT_ID" | jq '.'

echo -e "\nâœ… All tests completed!"
```
